# Dogememos

_This webapp was created as an excercise to practice with the Flask framework._

However, I want to improve it by adding a real database, categories, users. So it 
will be possible to register tasks and mark them as completed after they have been 
done.

If there are more views or improvements, you are free to submit a PR or create an 
issue. Check current issues and see if you can improve it.

Currently, a version has been deployed to a heroku server:
